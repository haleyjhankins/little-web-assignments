    <h1> That One Time I Climbed a Mountain </h1>

      <p class = intro>So while in Arizona this spring, I had the opportunity to climb a mountain... </p>

      <div class='top'>
        <p class ='paragraph1'>It very well could have gone down like this: </p>

      <div class='delirious'>
        <p>So there I was. Climbing a mountain in the hot desert sun. After a while, I began to feel some kinna' way. I felt feelings of fatigue, of excitement, regret... and after so many hours, the feeling that I, in fact, was the mountain goat. </p>

      <div class='victory'>
        <p>It took around 4 hours to climb all the way up and back down.There were several times where I questioned my judgement in starting this endeavor. However, the entire way I promised myself that if I could climb a mountain, there was nothing stopping me from learning JavaScript and completing my Front End boot camp. And that's exactly what I intend to do! </p>
